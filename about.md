## Background

I was born in Córdoba, Argentina several decades ago and I am currently living there. It used to be a really nice place to live, now streets are flooded with rubbish, blackouts happen just about every other day and protesters and motorists clash at every corner. The good thing, though, is that I am used to living there.

There are great things about Córdoba, too. Family and friends, just to name a few. University city, that too. The place where *Fernet con Coca* was invented. Great food. Most importantly, where my ashes are some day meant to be scattered: the football ground of [Club Atlético Belgrano](https://www.caboficial.com.ar/).

I am happily married and have two beautiful girls named Candelaria and Agustina.

## Music & Film

I listen to all kinds of music but my preferred genres are classic rock and blues. Anything from the sixties and early seventies: **Pink Floyd**, **The Doors**, **Bluesbreakers**, **Jimi Hendrix**, **Cream**, **Van Morrison**, and **Led Zeppelin**. Jimmy Smith is the man when it comes to funky jazz, and I also dig 70's soul—Marvin Gaye, The Delfonics, Millie Jackson, and Curtis Mayfield.

I consider myself a film buff. I watch the good, the bad and the ugly, but I always end up rooting for the greats: Ford, Wyler, Hitchcock, Ozu, Eisenstein, Altman, Lang, Powell and Pressburger, Ray, Lynch, Scorsese, and Kubrick. A special mention goes to the Coen brothers for *The Big Lebowski*—my favourite movie of all time.

## Sports

I wish I was a millionth the player Diego Maradona was, but I am rather a lacklustre, industrious midfielder sort of player. I enjoy the weekly kickabout although long gone are the times where I used to run down an eleven-a-side pitch. I also play tennis regularly and go for squash with mates. Having lived in the UK for a while, I cannot help but admit that my favourite new sport is darts (and the beer that goes with it!).

## Reading & Drinks

Reading gives me great pleasure. I consume everything from the eternal classics to the great novels of the 20th century—I have a soft spot for Paul Auster and Russian authors.

I enjoy drinking fine Malbecs, but when it comes to spirits, nothing can beat a **White Russian**.
