# Sebastián Freille

I am an academic economist. I teach and do research in public economics and political economy. I am based at the Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (UNC). My interests are in sub-national elections, political economy of redistribution, special interests groups, lobbying and corruption. I am and will always be a [Maradonian](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona).
