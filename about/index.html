        		<h1>About</h1>
				<p>In this section, you can learn more about me, things I like doing, browse through some photos and other activities that help me keep a healthy mind (or so I'd like to think). I was born in Cordoba, Argentina a few several decades ago and I am currently living there. Used to be a really nice place to live, now streets are flooded with rubbish, blackouts happen just about every other day and protesters and motorists clash at every corner. It gets worse. Well, unless you fancy being run over by a reckless delivery boy or gunned down just because you didn't want to have your flashy mobile stolen from you. The good thing, though, is that I am used to living there. Anyway, there are great things about Cordoba, too. Family and friends, just to name a few. University city, that too. The place were Fernet con Coca was invented. Great food, too. Most importantly, where my ashes are some day meant to be scattered, the football ground of the Club Atlético Belgrano.

I am happily married and I have a two beautiful baby girls named Candelaria and Agustina. Personal interests are widely varied but mostly include listening to 60’s psychedelia, watching cult movies, creative writing and IT stuff. I enjoy drinking fine Malbecs, but when it comes to spirits, nothing can beat a White Russian. I also enjoy playing footie and eating a proper Argentinian barbeque. 

I listen to all kinds of music but my preferred genres are classic rock and blues. In general, anything from the sixties, early seventies will do for me, but I particularly enjoy listening to Pink Floyd, The Doors, Bluesbreakers, Jimmy Hendrix, Cream, Van Morrison, and Led Zeppelin. Jimmy Smith is the man when it comes to jfunky jazz and I also dig 70's soul, specially Marvin Gaye, The Delfonics, Millie Jackson and Curtis Mayfield. As for recent stuff, I try to keep an open mind but normally end up listenting to bands such as Muse, Gogol Bordello, and singers such as Ray Lamontagne and Lissie. I consider myself a film buff. I watch the good, the bad and the ugly. But I always end up rooting for the greats with the likes of Ford, Wyler, Hitchcock, Ozu, Eisenstein, Altman, Lang, Powell and Pressburger, Ray, Lynch, Scorsese, and Kubrick. A special mention goes to the Coen brothers for imagining, writing and directing my favourite movie of all time, The Big Lebowski. Reading gives me great pleasure and I consume everything I can from the eternal classics to the great novels of the 20th century. I have a soft spot for Paul Auster and Russian authors. My knowledge of painting and sculpting is very limited but I enjoy going to museums and arthouses, and I like art in a general sense.

As football goes, I wish I was a millionth the player Diego Maradona was but I am rather a lacklustre, industrious midfielder sort of player. I like doing the weekly kickabout although long gone are the times where I used to run down an eleven-a-side pitch. I also play tennis regularly --although I am seriously considering retirement due to a string of bad losses-- and go for a regular squash sweat with mates. But, having lived in the UK for a while, I cannot help but admit that my favourite new sport is darts (and beer that goes with it!).</p>
